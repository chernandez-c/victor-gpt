## Chat Bot

This app is an interface to the GPT3 API or other apis like Chatgpt. 

In order to use it, you may need an Openai account and an API key.


### To run:

You will need to setup a .env file in the client directory. Make sure the file is named `.env` and nothing else.
`something.env` will not work.

```
REACT_APP_OPENAI_KEY=yourkey
```

Then just `npm start` inside the client directory. It should automatically load the page inside of a browser.
